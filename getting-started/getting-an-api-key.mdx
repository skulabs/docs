To begin using the SKULabs API, you'll need to generate an API key. Follow these steps:

## Quick Start

[Click here](https://app.skulabs.com/settings?add=true#advanced/api) to get sent to SKULabs and create a new API key immediately.

## Alternate Method

If the quick start method didn't work, you can follow these steps:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Find Account Settings">
  Go to your SKULabs [account settings](https://app.skulabs.com/settings).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Find Advanced">
  Navigate to the "[Advanced](https://app.skulabs.com/settings#advanced/api)" section.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select API">
  Select "[API](https://app.skulabs.com/settings#advanced/api)" to manage your API keys.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a Key">
    Add a new API key.
  </Step>
</Steps>
