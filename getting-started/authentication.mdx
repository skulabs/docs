To access the API endpoints, you need to authenticate your requests. Below are the available authentication methods:


<Steps>
  <Step title="Bearer Token Authentication">

  Include your access token in the Authorization header using the "Bearer" scheme.

  ```http
  Authorization: Bearer your_access_token_here
  ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="SKULabsToken Authentication">
  Similar to Bearer Token Authentication, but use the "SKULabsToken" scheme in the Authorization header.

  ```http
  Authorization: SKULabsToken your_access_token_here
  ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Basic Authentication">
  You can also use Basic Authentication by providing your API key as the password. The username can be any string.

  ```shell
  curl -u "skulabs:your_access_token_here" https://api.skulabs.com/
  ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>When you're ready to start using our API, replace "_your_access_token_here_" with your actual access token.</Tip>
