SKULabs enforces several bucket-based rate limits that you may encounter while using our API. Additionally, some endpoints have special rate limits or account-level locks to prevent abuse of bulk endpoints.

### Per-api-key limits
You are limited to 2 requests per second per API key.

## Per-account limits
You are limited to your plan's associated rate limit, broken up into hourly buckets. As of August 2024:
* Basic - 1000/day in buckets of 41/hour
* Premium - 100 000/day in buckets of 4 166/hour
* Enterprise - 300 000/day in buckets of 12 500/hour
* Enterprise 2X (Paid) in buckets of 25 000/hour
* Enterprise 4X (Paid) in buckets of 50 000/hour

## Endpoint limits
It is rare, but certain endpoints have custom rate limits, you may need to dynamically wait in these cases.

## Endpoint locks
Some endpoints have locks that prevent multiple requests from being processed simultaneously by API for the entire account. These are typically actions like bulk_reconcile, bulk_delete, or bulk_receive. You should queue and wait for each request to finish or implement an exponential fallback algorithm and resubmit your requests until you receive a 200, 202, or 203 status code.

## Dynamically waiting for rate limit resets.
If your 429 error contains an error object, you can wait `error.data.wait_seconds` seconds for your rate limit bucket to reset.
```
{ "error": { "message": "Rate limited. You are allowed etc...", data: { "wait_seconds": 8 } } }
```


<Tip>This number can be up to an hour or longer. Do not arbitrarily sleep your program in response to this error.</Tip>
